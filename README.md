# Predictive-Modeling
This Heart-failure-Prediction project includes four different Classification Algorithms and their performance evaluation:
    - Logistic Regression
    - KNearest Neighbor
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tunning
    
Introduction:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally and Heart Failure is a common event caused by CVDs. This project is to create a model for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure using the 12 features from the dataset.
